            <p>Sorry about the below post. VSC is very unclear about how to turn on Word Wrap...</p>
            <p>I've really been struggling as of late with holding friendships, mostly because of things I do, I think. Ever since a long time friendgroup (since ~2022) split up and broke apart in early July, things have been pretty bad. I've been more prone to lashing out at people (I lashed out the day of the split up, hours before the formation of the "friend group without me", because one of my friends who i respected for situation handling randomly took a 180 and took my server from me), I've been possibly isolating, and I think I've been a little more down. I used to get angry and give off insane person vibes.</p>
            <p>I don't anymore, but instead of being angrier (which has been MUCH better without my old friends, surprisingly), I'm just lonelier. Maybe I just don't know how to tolerate people and be respectful? I don't know. Things have been hard. I used to be way more social in 2019, but now it's just been so much harder. I can be myself, but then I have to doubt and be skeptical of every little thing. Every little weird thing needs to be watched under security cam and microscope.</p>
            <p>Anyway, I put up a little post <a href="https://blog.spacehey.com/entry?id=1875379">here</a>, if you got a minute to relate or listen, I'd love to have a bit of attention on it, this is kind of my way to let out some held in feelings. This won't be a frequent thing. Just need to make a one time exception.</p>

            <p>i like how on servers where server owners let the users decide if they want to be unreportable or not, you can turn off No Chat Reports' settings to hide all indicators, and then you just see a grey bar that identifies literally all No Chat Reports users. like it's literally so hilarious that it's an <i>almost</i> perfect way to dog whistle fellow NCR users...</p>
            <p>assuming that clients haven't already integrated this</p>

            <p>Found this new launcher called "Quantum Launcher", which is still work in progress. New build is going to have ely.by support, and in the future there'll be support for servers, OptiForge / OptiFabric (like Legacy Launcher!), Prism/MultiMC instance importing, etc. Can't wait to see where they go with it, especially considering it's Rust based and took a shot at Prism for not being as "feature complete" as Quantum is, I'm curious to see if they actually go on that promise.</p>
            <p>Oh, and please add MMC Instance exporting in the next version :(</p>

            <p>this might be a bad luck when a minecraft server inevitably has their staff go through my website and they see this and think i should be banned for tinkering a bit too far... oh well, i'm going to spoil my secrets anyway. just of note that <b>i don't automate this</b> because that's obviously against server rules, and i know the commands enough to type them manually anyway. plus actually typing makes the delays look less automated, so you can see the abnormal gaps and assume "yeah, a human's doing this"</p>
            <p>for those running servers on anything paper adjacent (spigot, purpur, folia, everything that can take a Bukkit or Paper plugin), i notice nobody sets up their permissions the same! some people block /help, some don't block anything at all, some replace /help with something custom... and others have owners who think blocking every command under the sun except /msg is helpful.</p>
            <p>one of my joyous things to do (as a guilty pleasure, though not to do anything malicious) is to run /help then /plugins to see if those commands are blocked. that's it, i just like seeing servers blocking /help then immediately forgetting that /plugins exist. plus, if you let me look at your plugins, i'll assume you have nothing to hide and even if i find something i don't like, you likely advertised that anyway and i just didn't read your ad enough!</p>
            <p>and of course, servers that block both are mad suspicious, and i'm less likely to take you seriously. and also, as i speak i'm putting together a list of commands that are featured in typical shit p2w slop servers, so uhm... hi! you can't hide all the commands from me forever!</p>
            <p>sorry for the silly post, haha... i just need to admit that i like to do this for shits and giggles. and also, it gives me peace of mind seeing in /plugins that there's just stuff i don't mind on it!</p>

            <p>not to be the paranoriac asshole that tries to go out of their way to bitch about what they don't like, but i think that david baszucki should be privately investigated solely for the damage he's done to his platform.</p>
            <details class="readmore">
            <summary>view potentially sensitive post</summary>
            <p>his platform was originally founded for kids, and he turned around and turned it into an online dating space with serious problems related to sexual content. then he turns around and enables them by letting them make the bypassed emotes their heart desires.</p>
            <p>i don't know about you, but i think something sounds mentally ill about that</p>
            <p>god, i just fucking hate this so much because roblox is my platform and the only one where i feel i can put together characters and renders without feeling like it's too much, and now some stupid fuck in the chair is basically giving a bunch of predators the tools to wreck havoc on the platform. and now i'm out of a hobby again</p>
            <p>so NOW i have to go out of my way to hunger strike again just to become desperate because everybody is on roblox but don't have an offplatform alternative. if zeekers can go off roblox and make lethal company, and Nelson Sexton and go off roblox (after making "Deadzone") and make unturned, then what is stopping everybody else..??</p>
            <p>please roblox, get a new ceo that will actually care. get a ceo that does not ignore predators for fucks sake</p>

            <p>modern whitelisted servers are so dumb to try and join because they treat everything like a job application. like i've literally started lying on my applications about why i want to join servers because it's so ridiculous.</p>
            <p>"i want to join your server because i think i could be a great new member" no, it's because i want to play a GAME and hopefully somehow learn how making friends works. not because i'm a social butterfly with no flaws whatsoever or whatever i lied and said on my application. hell, i don't even REMEMBER my application.</p>
            <p>sorry, just a little silly post</p>

            <p>somebody please make a video about a joke, it's about a guy and a sandwich, and then the punchline is just some dude going to a guy with a sandwich like "my brother in christ, you invented your sandwich, just eat it" that would be fucking hilarious</p>

            <p>the way people would genuinely ask for toilets in minecraft, i really want to be able to stub my toe in minecraft! we can burn ourselves in fires, can get hit by other people to death, can suffocate ourself with sand, could fall from a height... but i can't stub my toe after walking on stairs and accidently hitting a full block with full force?</p>
