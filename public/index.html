            <p>modern whitelisted servers are so dumb to try and join because they treat everything like a job application. like i've literally started lying on my applications about why i want to join servers because it's so ridiculous.</p>
            <p>"i want to join your server because i think i could be a great new member" no, it's because i want to play a GAME and hopefully somehow learn how making friends works. not because i'm a social butterfly with no flaws whatsoever or whatever i lied and said on my application. hell, i don't even REMEMBER my application.</p>
            <p>sorry, just a little silly post</p>

            <p>somebody please make a video about a joke, it's about a guy and a sandwich, and then the punchline is just some dude going to a guy with a sandwich like "my brother in christ, you invented your sandwich, just eat it" that would be fucking hilarious</p>

            <p>the way people would genuinely ask for toilets in minecraft, i really want to be able to stub my toe in minecraft! we can burn ourselves in fires, can get hit by other people to death, can suffocate ourself with sand, could fall from a height... but i can't stub my toe after walking on stairs and accidently hitting a full block with full force?</p>
