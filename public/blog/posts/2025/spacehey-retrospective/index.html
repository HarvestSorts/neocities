        <p>5 years ago when I was 14, I was on quite a few social media platforms used by majorites. TikTok, Discord, Twitter, Tumblr... You can name it! Over the years I've come and gone in many places, some more places I've been to being Instagram (which i am never touching again, unless if you put a gun to my head or really forced my hand), Snapchat (the worst message platform i've used, ever), Bluesky, Skype, Mastodon...</p>
<p>I had been to many places when it comes to Social Media. And now, the only three important places I can be found on is SpaceHey, Discord, Neocities, kind of GitHub and sorta Reddit. A lot changes, doesn't it?</p>
<p>My experience with SpaceHey in general has kind of been over the place. I've met genuinely wonderful people on here (with <em>varying</em> backgrounds) and have a few times made lasting friendships that are still going today. That's great, but how did we get here, where it's practically the only active place I'm on, other than Discord?</p>
<p>This assumes a lot that Discord is not a &quot;social media&quot;. I've quite many social media platforms, but Discord is technically the only &quot;major&quot; example (excluding YouTube, which I don't think counts) of a social platform run by big tech that I actually use day-to-day. Twitter is toxic, Instagram is toxic, TikTok is toxic, Tumblr is toxic <em>and</em> has crazy people stories, Snapchat is mostly used by people in my schools that I don't connect with...</p>
<p>Discord is another one of those &quot;toxic&quot; platforms in nature, and I couldn't ever really blame anybody for hating Discord. It's a source of hell for a lot of people and generally just run by idiots who want to add nothing but monetization and monetization to the platform. But, it's also the fact that it's the only real platform I can get a bunch of friends on. It's a place that I check often and have on all my devices, has a bunch of features I want, good modding... And so, I check it a bit more than SpaceHey, because it has other social features I really like.</p>
<p>This kind of thing has basically become another &quot;social pressure&quot; situation where I can't really &quot;migrate&quot; to a Discord alternative, but really, there's no other good alternatives, lol. Guilded is run by ROBLOX, Revolt has no rich presence at all, NO platform has implemented Discord's Rich Presence system, a lot of games already lack Rich Presence, I'm not using TeamSpeak if I have to pay a host to run me a server... etc, etc, etc. Discord just &quot;works&quot; and that's all I'm going to use for a while. Sorry to those who can survive off just SpaceHey.</p>
<p>Right, the topic. I'm throwing Discord out there because it's basically the only &quot;modern&quot; social media I've fit into. I hate everything else, mainly because either I'm never seen or I just so strongly hate the userbases to the point that I'd rather avoid the entire thing like the plague to get away from all the people who write a bunch of annoying, negative comments. Tiktok and YouTube are nothing but spam. By the time I started settling and getting used to SpaceHey's slow pace, I've practically thrown everything else.</p>
<p>Because SpaceHey actually makes me feel seen. If I had to list problems with a lot of social media platforms, it probably has to go like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>TikTok is used by so many diverse people, but nobody I actually want to interact with. Its algorithms pushes stuff to me pretty much days after it passed, the comment section is full of kids doing comment manipulation junk that makes you think there's a hair on the screen, fake like button, etc. Also, 50% of the time, the &quot;nerds&quot; in the comments are misinformed and run on ages old advice. And also, attention span, I want mine back, thank you.</li>
<li>YouTube needs its comments completely stripped, its CEO changed and its AI moderation completely removed. And also, a couple of notable figures on YouTube right now need to be taken out back... to a nice dinner with a spam bot, so we can stop hearing about all the drama.</li>
<li>Discord is overmonetized and is a tag team haven for youth harm along with ROBLOX, but unlike ROBLOX, Discord is an essential part of my social interactions right now</li>
<li>Twitter was ALWAYS toxic and Bluesky has practically outclassed it by now. Only reason you need Twitter still is for following companies, but I'd rather use XCancel.</li>
<li>Tumblr's underground communities are a horror and share a lot of red flags with a very miniscule % of SpaceHey's userbase. The clean side of Tumblr is mostly boring or just memes.</li>
<li>Instagram is as bad as TikTok. If not, worse. The only time I seriously used Instagram was for DMs, but even then I still dislike it.</li>
<li>Snapchat was mostly used by the people in my school, and has earned the reputation from me for being the app that the popular kids and &quot;trend follower&quot; users use. Sorry for viewing you so low, Snap. I like my chat history when it SAVES without me forcing it to every message.</li>
<li>Bluesky is Twitter but predominately LGBTQ audiences. AKA, Twitter without the right wing hate; overly political and sometimes with some cool artists worth commissioning.</li>
<li>Mastodon is just Fediverse Bluesky, and was practically made redundant when Bsky came along.</li>
<li>Skype is dead and was always buggy.</li>
</ul>
<p>yeah... I have a lot of things to say about modern social media.</p>
<p>I don't really fit into these social platforms, because I'm just very stingy with interactions. A lot of the time, the interactions on these platforms don't matter to me. I don't care at all about followers, or becoming trending, or really anything, but I know a lot of people who do, whether to trend follow and fit in with the userbase mould or not. If anything, it seems most of my friends use them and struggle to get on SpaceHey at all.</p>
<p>SpaceHey came along and practically just completely fucking changed how I view Social Media and how I use it. When I was starting to pick up SpaceHey and adapt to its pace, I was using Blip to post my thoughts (as opposed to bsky) and also semi-active on a few alternatives to try and stay active on the internet. By the time I got to here and started <em>really</em> kicking off my interest in writing blogs, I basically abandoned everything and used purely just SpaceHey in terms of social media (apart from Reddit, where I used to search for Minecraft ads).</p>
<p>And this is pretty much the only social platform I really turn to, to read posts and post comments on. Everything else kind of just sucks. And since then, SpaceHey entirely changed how I angle Social Media. Who knows what is next.</p>
