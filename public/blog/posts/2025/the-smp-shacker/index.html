        <p>This post should have a bit of silly context, especially because this is just a longer form of the bulletin I just made! If you looked at <a href="https://aprilhvs.neocities.org/">my NeoCities page</a> (which has a brand new button btw! please replace it people), you would have saw that on August 9th, I joined a bunch of SMPs and got accepted! For convenience, let's call the Minecraft SMP this happened on, &quot;Retro SMP&quot;. That's far from an accurate name. I don't care. Privacy needs a shitty name replacement.</p>
<p>So on Retro, I picked a spot on a hill. Placed my bed and chest, the basics, and settled off for the night. I was dizzy the night I logged on, so I was kind of out of it and just wanted to get my bed sorted out.</p>
<p>I go to bed and don't log back in until yesterday afternoon, to find out some dude built a shack on my hill, left his stuff in a chest and put a sign in front of my spawn point basically saying &quot;Hey! There's a shack on your right if you want to use it!&quot;.<br>
THIS MAN. BUILT A LITERAL SHACK ON MY LAND. AND JUST GAVE IT AWAY???</p>
<p>He didn't even take his stuff back. I put signs back because I just want him to pick up all of his shit from his chest because I don't want to take his shit, and there's been no response for like a day. The dude's definitely logged in since then. I think he forgot he built this beautiful little shack at all. Like...</p>
<p>This is some CRAZY lore. Who just casually builds a shack on your lawn???</p>
