        <p>SpaceHey is a platform that can be hard for a lot to navigate, especially for somebody who might have migrated from other places. I'm one of those people, using SpaceHey as a sort of "alternative social media" that I've been using more than anything I used to use. And with that, comes, well,</p><p>A lot of care for my own friendship count, for some reason.</p><p>When it came to "moots" culture, I was always out of place. I didn't care about my follower count, usually I held Mutuals with people I already talk to (even a little), and I generally just didn't attention seek. When I was on Twitter, my one and only goal was simply, just post what I was thinking of that day, as intended previously.</p><p>But then I made the move to SpaceHey and it's like I now self-impose my own limits. Always keep the friends list ONLY full of people I care about, continually remove people who go inactive or I never get anything back from (or find bulletins to read/interact), make an effort to add specifically people I would want to actually talk to and get to know... That kind of stuff.</p><p>I don't know, it's kind of weird that I've just suddenly started caring a lot about friend counts and what friendships I hold when a couple of years ago, I just made effortless friendships with people, even if there was just one hobby we were doing together and I didn't know ANYTHING else about any other interests.</p><p>Do I just care about the details too much now? Do I pay attention too much to people? I don't know, am I just an extrovert wrapped in social anxiety, and the "introvert" label I have is just... irrelevant? All of those times I thought I was a genuine introvert were just total bullshit? I'm super social with people I know, but I don't like big groups. Fuck, what the fuck am I??</p><p>Why do I care so much about who I add on SpaceHey..???</p>
