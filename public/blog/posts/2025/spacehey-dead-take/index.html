            <h1>My take on SpaceHey being "dead" (as somebody who is active on both SpaceHey and modern socials)</h1>
            
            
            <time>07/26/2025</time>
            
        </header>
        <p>I initially joined SpaceHey in 2023 and was on and off since 2023 due to a variety of reasons, such as losing interest (expecting overstimulating first interactions, believing myself the site is dead, etc) and generally just being too lazy to log onto a site I felt I wasn't benefitting from. I thought I would give my own take on SpaceHey being &quot;dead&quot;, as somebody who is between the &quot;fast&quot; social media (specifically Discord. I am also a former TikTok user) and SpaceHey's oldschool approach to it.</p>
<p>The cycle for new users, unfortunately, is inevitable at this point. You probably know what I mean.</p>
<p>I see new blog posts every once and a while about people remembering to log in after months, new users who sometimes end up not replying to me and disappearing the week after, etc. That cycle of &quot;make account, spice it up, add a few people, get bored and leave&quot; is going to be inevitable, because SpaceHey changes how people view social media. If you were a TikTok user and expect to drown in attention on every post, obviously Spacehey is going to bore you. SpaceHey is not the kind of site where you could make a post and get a lot of attention, it took time for me to accept that too, but I don't make posts expecting attentions anymore.</p>
<p>I do end up getting a lot of hanging friend requests to people that have never logged on in a while, too. I've recalled some friend requests I sent after finding out somebody last logged on two months ago, and my friend request was also almost two months ago. I do also get the perspectives of people who end up getting bored, because in a way, I'm also bored. My main type of communication has always been Discord, which is a &quot;fast&quot; paced platform for most, and sometimes that doesn't make some people comfortable, as Discord is also the place where a lot of bad things have happened for some people.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, SpaceHey is just the second place I go to. If you've only ever <em>been</em> a SpaceHey user and have avoided ever other social media <em>perfectly</em>, you probably don't get it. But for myself, I'll sometimes log into SpaceHey, be thrown off by the slow pace, and just believe the site is dead because nothing comes to me. Keep in mind that I struggle to start friendships with people, so that part isn't just a SpaceHey problem. SpaceHey made it easier to become friends with people, definitely, unlike modern social media, I can actually approach people, and on the off chance, actually connect with people.</p>
<p>But every once and a while, nothing. I'll be unable to take the slow pace and I'll dip early.</p>
<p>Of course, that's ironic, considering I'm active on a social media platform mainly meant for active messaging, with colored status indicators and all, but that's just what it is. I joined Discord (first as an underage in 2017, then properly) in 2019, and for my entire teenhood, that's just been the standard for me. And it remained the standard for 4 years until I joined SpaceHey, of course SpaceHey was going to look like alien magic. Plus, TikTok had me ensared in 2020 before I started going on and off since 2022, then dark in 2024.</p>
<p>It's just that it's a time thing. On some days, of course, I like SpaceHey's slower vibe. I would post a blog and be okay with the slow pace, completely fine with how slow everything happens, and that just gives me the time and energy to surf through profiles in post. A lot of times, however, I just step away early and check back later, expecting a notification to await me. It's mostly a dopamine thing.<br>
Plus, searching for things is tedious. I write blogs, research is already tedious. Searching for things to reply to and do is even worse with somebody of my attention span.</p>
<p>I get both sides, especially people who say that the people say that SpaceHey is &quot;dead&quot; are just not trying hard enough, because I do see it! Blogs get made, people actually respond to you, some people log on frequently enough to be even somewhat active, and there's still a sense of community, even if said community is arguing with each other. Though, I still resonate with the impatient kids, because SpaceHey in general is slow. Not everybody has the patience for that. That pisses off people who have the patience, sure, but everybody's going to be different in the end. You can't just put every person on the world on a hot spice and expect everybody to like it... :P</p>
