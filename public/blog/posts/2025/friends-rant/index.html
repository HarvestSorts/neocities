        <p>As somebody who is usually a shut-in and just doesn't speak to people much without slowly warming the dial. As a result, most of my interactions with potential future friends tend to mostly be about a bit of yapping back and forth in hopes it snowballs into a state where I can yap on my own and randomly pop in without thinking about the awkward part about that.</p>
<p>That has worked for many friendships I've made over SpaceHey; just exchanging a long conversation first thing about interests. When my go-to idea is to leave a nice and long profile comment after getting my friend request accepted and (god forgive) I get a nice yap back with some answers, sometimes that's all the spark I need to start a nice conversation over SpaceHey. And then the chances of possibly unadding the other person after the first week are reduced by maybe 25%, assuming they don't randomly go offline forever afterwards.</p>
<p>What does that have to do with this topic, though? That's because in the past 2-3 months alone, I've either not gotten anything out of doing that or just get demotivated halfway through writing the comment, because of other things.</p>
<p>I generally try to avoid vent posts and purely avoid ranting unless if I can add a comical or informational hint to it, because if I was just to rant angrily like &quot;I hate my life, nothing comes together&quot; without a takeaway, it would just feel like a vent. So when I talk about rants and when I actually write rants, it always has a takeaway.<br>
i.e: If I'm ranting about OptiFine, I'm going to also talk about the downsides with unbiased information. (&quot;You literally cannot even step forward, because of the lag. That's right, this increases the LAG.<br>
<small>this is not an example. optifine doesn't actually do this. i just needed something that sounded like what im talking abt, sorry</small></p>
<p>But this time, this is different. I just need to talk real for a moment.</p>
<p>Genuinely, I don't know how I made it through ANY of my teen years. When I turned fresh 13 in 2019, I was mostly in Roleplay spaces and was mostly celebrating the fact my ROBLOX account was now free from the underage filter. The games I played then mostly consisted of Hmm (that meme game where you open doors), RoCitizens and maybe if you were lucky, After The Flash. How I was social then was literally miracles, because I could confidently start RPs with people and type &quot;abc&quot; in the chat without a problem.</p>
<p>And that worked. That built up some friend groups I visited a lot, got me in a lot of fun roleplays that I even hold on to this day, got me in places I felt I was safe in, helped me develop my characters... I kept remembering names, kept roleplaying to keep my happy up, and while I was a troublesome teen and a bit of a nightmare to deal with on the family end, I kept pushing. And I was having fun and making memories.</p>
<p>I think it was easier to be social then because I actually grinded my ass off to be part of a community I liked. I put my all into people, met a whole wide range of people with varying amounts of passion for Roleplay, sometimes got to do things with them outside of Roleplay... I was a social butterfly. Speaking up for myself was easy, it was easy to defend myself or speak out against others because I was confident. I was not as introverted as I had become later on, and wasn't aware of the internet's true horrors yet to care. I actually put effort into approaching people. I fit in because that's just how I was.</p>
<p>Times have changed so fucking fast. I have to bring that up and bring up all this history because we need to also look at right now: a complete mess. In 2025 alone (6 years since my &quot;prime&quot;), everything is just all fallen apart. 90% of friends I've made then have changed in one way or another, and I get some of them, but others are ridiculous. I knew a few people that became TikTok induced maniacs, or became problematic in ways that I didn't align with. Also met people who seemingly changed for the better, yet the friends they talk to are rude and I cannot stand them. Sometimes, it isn't even their fault. Sometimes our interests just align so little after they quit RP, that the only real tie we had left was basically cut. Because that's all I usually did with partners, just roleplay my ass out if I could.</p>
<p>I kept in contact with about one person from back then, and even they've turned into a ghost. They've been struggling mentally, been in a shittier place in the house than I ever could, they've become old enough that they could even be working a job while they're off. They're the only person I've trusted, aligned with and genuinely related to strongly enough that I didn't drift from them. And yet, they're struggling and M.I.A. in what I could consider the &quot;worst&quot; part of my life. I fucking owe them an apology for being a turd when I was 13, if anything.</p>
<p>Looking at how that's changed, a lot has changed since my social prime in 2019. Compared to then, I hesitate to reach out first when I add people over SpaceHey. Sometimes even if I get the confidence to do so, sometimes small talk or other &quot;hi! how's that project you're working&quot; small sentence stuff, just doesn't click. When I've made friendships, usually it was after a length profile comment reply to a profile comment I wrote. That was usually the best case scenario.</p>
<p>This isn't entirely about SpaceHey, of course. Just a small example.</p>
<p>There's also Roleplay. Since I was stalked and defaced in 2023, I'm scared to step in Roleplay environments without the irrational fear that maybe, that same man would be in the crowd. Even if I'm in a game I KNOW he wouldn't know about, I feel out of place. I have to spend about 5 minutes pondering if it's worth it to reply &quot;abc&quot; to start a roleplay (if you're lucky to find one of those now, which could be it's own post), and by the time I've taken the risk, they're gone. Sometimes, even making decisions like that gives me a mini panic attack. Like my heart gets a little uncomfortable when I try to socialize like this.</p>
<p>I just don't know how I've even made friendships at all! It seems total luck based, and it doesn't help my case that I'm pretty much a glass cannon when it comes to socializing first. I might one day take that risk and go first, by pure luck, but sometimes when I do, nothing comes of it. And then I just wait for the next opportunity to do it all again.</p>
<p>I genuinely CANNOT grasp how I survived my teen years making the friends I did through 2019-2022, because everybody then might as well have been problematic OTHER THAN the single person I met then. And even THEN, I don't know how to make friendships now. I am literally socially outcasting myself by doing this, and I continue to do it??? My newest friendships have been literal magic and everytime I make a new friend, there's always that subtle reminder that something is coming.</p>
<p>My longterm IRL friendships have already broken off because I'm very reactive and emotional about what I work on. There's no saying when somebody else is going.</p>
<p>I probably also dug my own grave here by being so picky. I've become so used to meeting either dry people or just so ready to prepare for almost no chemistry, that I've literally been letting that bias control what friend requests I accept or not.</p>
<p>Ahhh, there's so much to unpack. I've gone from being a social butterfly to a literal fool. This is my first time coming out about this, because I'm generally opposed to making vents and actual rants. I don't like doing it, I've been uncomfortable binge reading vents and rants before. But this time, I think I need to let this go.</p>
