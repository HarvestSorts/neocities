        <p>Sorry for the weird, inaccurate, possibly clickbaity title... It was between &quot;The Aether&quot; and &quot;OptiFine&quot;, and saying OptiFine was a good thing to happen to the Minecraft community gives it too much credit. This post is a bit of a buffer between my last few posts and any future posts, because I've been struggling to write anything big. This post is just a little small, bite sized thing to enjoy.</p>
<p>My take might be a <em>little</em> self-indulgent, especially because I thought the best fitting title was &quot;best thing since The Aether&quot;, which is a bit of an over reach... But I promise this is meaningful.</p>
<hr>
<p>I'll just put my take on the table right here and just say right off the bat that Sodium is a <strong>big</strong> advancement in modding. No really, the take is about Sodium's advancements in the performance scene!</p>
<p>OptiFine back in the beta days was <em>kind of</em> effective and was definitely very new, having come right out of early 2011 and was created around the early stages of Minecraft's beta stage. The game has been out of Alpha for a few months and was starting to slowly round out into something that would eventually make the building blocks for what the game is today. Well, what the game was before 1.9...</p>
<p>Point is, it was around for years, from 2011 all the way through <em>ALL</em> the early and mid game releases. It chugged through the famous 1.8 that minigame servers use today, through the combat update, 1.12's changes, the aquatic update and the changes to villages, and through every update after, despite having not really getting anything more significant or better optimizing since about 1.8.</p>
<p>And then Sodium popped up during the Nether update (Sodium v0.1.0) and practically threw OptiFine out of the window for people who <em>only</em> used it for performance. Since then, Sodium is in version 0.6.13 and the advancements this mod made lead to a Forge focused port, native NeoForge support for Sodium, Sodium being integrated into clients all around, an introduction to many people for the power of what Modding really does...</p>
<p>Sodium kind of just changed the dynamic of everything. OptiFine, a tool many people had used &quot;just to run the game better&quot;, was practically now behind as Sodium rushed to get ahead of the scene. For some people on exotic configs, maybe they didn't feel it, but for a majority of people like myself who make an effort to tweak settings and dig around, yeah, it makes a difference.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how to put into words just how to say Sodium improved a lot of game performance to me. There's a lot of complications, such as some systems not exactly having the best drivers or being too outdated to benefit from Sodium, the type of version you choose to game on, what other mods you pair with it, but as a baseline, Sodium had pretty much become an essential. OptiFine had just become a tool for older versions. Sodium kind of outdid any use I had for OptiFine, and while I don't use Shaders due to how fast they cook my computer, Iris basically already deals with that scenario too.</p>
<p>I don't know if there's much else to say. Sodium is just a miracle for optimization, and ever mod that follow suite since then, including many modern essential mods have just made a better, stronger standard that OptiFine ever was.</p>
